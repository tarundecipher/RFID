Conditions For Sampling The Camera Module

1. Sampling should start at the rising edge of the PCLK.
2. Sampling should occur only when HREF is HIGH.
3. Rising edge of the HREF signals the start of the line.
4. Falling edge of the HREF signals the end of the line.
5. Falling edge of the VSYNC signsals the start of the frame and Rising edge
   the end of the frame.
6. After the clock signal is applied on the XCLK pin the HREF,VSYNC and D0-D7 
   pins start driving.
